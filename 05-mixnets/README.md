#   Drastijk: Dijkstrian mixnet

Here we propose an uber-paranoid message-passing mixnet where
participants are not aware of senders or recipients of messages
(which is commonplace), but also of the network's topology. The
only indormation a participant has is the following:

 1. entry points to connect to the network,
 2. public keys of their contacts.

We assume some sort of preferential-attachment network formation
which creates a topology of a constant diameter, although that
is not essential for the network's algorithms; this only ensures
reasonable path lengths. We assume that participants have vague
understanding of the network's size (e.g. 10000s of participants
of millions).

##  Routing announces

Participants do not announce their public keys or their identity
to the network; those are only known to their contacts. Instead,
an initial routing announce is: 
    `A(0) = SHA256 ( ID + timestamp)`, 
where the timestamp is rounded to the routing table update
period (say, 1 hour) and the ID is an arbitrary globally unique
ID known to your contact(s). By default, the ID is your public
key. Any subsequent announce (for path length 1, 2 and so on) is
like `A(i+1) = SHA256( A(i) )` Upon receiving an announce, a
node typically has no knowledge of either the recipient or the
distance, but it can produce an `A(i+1)` annonce and forward it
to immediate contacts.

Note that having an `A(i)` announce, we can see that any
`A(i+k)` announce is inferior: it leads to the same destination
but takes more hops. So, a Drastijk node can make routing
decisions without knowing either destinations or distances!

Also note that announce propagation ends naturally as all the
nodes have some path to the destination (without knowing which
is which).

The message forwarding algorithm is straightforward: accept a 
message for `A(i+1)`, fetch `A(i)` from own records, forward the
message to the contact who sent `A(i)`.

This forms the *baseline* datagram forwarding model (like an IP
packet is the baseline model for the Internet).

##  Messages

Use ToyTLV, a simple type-length-value convention. A ToyTLV
message consists of:

 1. one-byte message type ([a-z] for short, [A-Z] for long
    messages, where short is up to 255 bytes of payload)
 2. message length (1 byte for short, 4 for long)
 3. message body of the specified length

A routing announce thus has a format 
    `a 32 sha256hash` (34b in all cases).
A message has a format 
    `M len sha256hash message_text` (34b or more).

We imply TCP-like transport between nodes (WebSocket etc).

##  Problems

The basic model has very basic functionality and some obvious
weaknesses. For example, once you know somebody's routing ID,
you can announce it yourself (and thus intercept or sabotage
some of communication). That should not scare us as the basic
IPv4 model is equally limited and vulnerable. (In fact, you have
to be a kernel developer to have access to raw IPv4 - that
already says a lot.) The idea is to build on top of the basic
model the same way the Internet ecosystem was built on top of
IPv4. But, let's do it Bonsai-size, we are not rebuilding the
Internet yet :)

Note that *technically* our routing table sizes are O(N), which
is more or less the the same as IPv4 has. Although, there is a
pretty big constant factor difference as BGP routing announces
whole networks, not nodes/users like Drastijk does.

Possible directions of work include:

 1. Designing and implementing delivery acknowledgements
 2. ...implement MTU and congestion control using (1)
 3. ...onion encyphering so a message looks different at every
    step (with a static message one can match different steps)
 4. ...some algorithm to try alternative paths (suppose some
    path is not working or gets congested); may use (1)
 5. ...a strategy to vary routing paths between periods
 6. ...a strategy to prevent routing table flooding (fake 
    announces); simple passive strategies are preferred
 7. ...other ways of sabotage and defences against them
 8. ...strategies for key rotation (Joe is malicious, I want
    to change my key so everyone but Joe gets the new one)
 9. ...strategies for contact sharing (friend-of-a-friend)
    probably based on Diffie-Hellman; the idea is to *limit
    the use of one routing identificator to one contact*
    thus ruling out fake 3rd announces,
10. ...implement hypertext on top of such a network
    (use Markdown for document format), may use (2)
11. ...implement name system for such a network (like DNS)
12. ...implement simple e-mail for such network assuming
    there are full nodes (announced) and clients attached
    to full nodes; may use (11)
